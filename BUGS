BUGS and suggested enhancements

Irc 
	• pasting a large block only sends the first line to the channel
	• still something odd about noscroll behaviour
	• non threadsafe use of bufio between infothread and mainwin
	• implement redial
	• list on plumb channel for irc channel urls

Charon
	• rewrite forms handling: come up with something much better
	• plumb images to external prog (the new wm/view)
	• cleanup IMG text to be single glyph with superscript
	• add standalone charon script
	• remove tk support altogether. than remove libtk and /man/9

Acme
	• Crashes when Debug opens lots of windows,
		writes invalid addresses to addr file.
	• allow acme:sac to also run under wm
	• middle-click sh commands that include comments causes
		sh to give parse errors. e.g. man 1 bind # bind(1)
		The problem is just the newline is missing
	• 'Look args' doesn't work if text is already selected within the Body.
	• mouse chording command args in client windows, like irc,
		doesn't work because of the round trip
	• when window opens that should have expanded tag it
		only has one line until the window is moved.
	• right-click on /mnt/acme/1 or other acme served file will freeze acme

Debug
	• implement breakpoints
	• provide nice acme stack navigation without having to stop the proc
	• plumb filenames to full filname path and location of step

Mail/Mailpop3
	• quote "From " when saving mail
	• Mailpop3 hangs. probably a race condition somewhere
	• use factotum for pop password
	• use default direct /mail/box/user not current directory [FIXED  for Mailpop3]
	• pop3 can't handle large messages, runs out of heap.
	• with ssl working it should really be part of factotum
	• merge Sascha's changes to Reply
	• autocomplete email addresses
	• listen on plumb for email addresses to mailto
	• merge in rfc822.b library

Calendar
	• access to Schedule needs to be locked.
	• print events for current week
	• use better defaults so schedule file already exists is mounted

sendmail.b
	• need "send" client to append to other user's mailboxes
	if no '@' and user's mailbox exists, then append.
	• add ssl3 and send mail to gmail

daytime.b
	the string2tm doesn't work on the rfc822 dates in Mail

httpd
	• connection keep-alive hangs when interacting through
	telnet. probably need to replace bufio in the implementation.
	• test download of ranges.
	• cleanup directory. move CGI stuff out of there.

rpc
	• refactor disk/kfscmd, factotum/rpc, ndb/dnsquery, etc.


factotum
	• acme client to get authinfo dialog/feedkey
	• rework all commands that take password to use factotum
	• passwordsafe replacement as acme client using factotum

styxpersist.b
	• doesn't work
	• develop further to include lookup of registry, 
		lookup using virgil maintain.
	• look at more recent (iwp9 2006) work done on p9p 
		for persistent connections

sort
	• runs out of memory.
	• do more testing and add options to external sort /appl/mapreduce/sort.b

Acme clients
	juke
	pivotTable
	Search
	dialog/feedkey
	autocomplete -- type in the tag line, and the window contents 
		refresh with matching words. like google suggest.
	ctl-space for java object interfaces
	AST client (really? do we really want to go down this path?)

Chat
	mount -C rc4_256 -k caerwyn.canto tcp!canto.hopto.org!6683 /n/chat
	causes mount: mount failed: i/o on hungup channel
			58 "Sh":fail:mount failed
	first few attempts but works afterward

man pages
	Calendar
	Chat
	Irc
	Debug
	stackv
	Sql
	charon acme client
	remove unused man pages
	remove tk /man/9
	remove prefab, wm, other unused stuff
	rebuild INDEX using inferno only tools
	remove from /man/3 that only apply to native
	missing sys-byte2char(2)
	use Salva's man script instead of /appl/cmd/man.b
	
web hosting
	create acme sac web page like plan9port with full man pages and source
	navigable online.
