Irc 
	• pasting a large block only sends the first line to the channel
	• still something odd about noscroll behaviour
	• non threadsafe use of bufio between infothread and mainwin
	• implement redial
	• channel names as command line args
	• list on plumb channel for irc channel urls

Charon
	• clean up forms handling
	• plumb images to external prog
	• cleanup IMG text to be single glyph with superscript
	• add standalone charon script
	• remove tk support altogether. than remove libtk and /man/9

Acme
	• Crashes when Debug opens lots of windows,
	writes invalid addresses to addr file.
	• allow acme:sac to also run under wm
	• middle-click sh commands that include comments causes
	sh to give parse errors. e.g. man 1 bind # bind(1)
	The problem is just the newline is missing
	• 'Look args' doesn't work if text is already selected within the Body.
	• mouse chording command args in client windows, like irc,
	doesn't work because of the round trip

Debug
	• implement breakpoints
	• provide nice acme stack navigation without having to stop the proc
	• plumb filenames to full filname path and location of step

Mail/Mailpop3
	• quote "From " when saving mail
	• Mailpop3 hangs. probably a race condition somewhere
	• use factotum for pop password
	• use default direct /mail/box/user not current directory [FIXED  for Mailpop3]
	• pop3 can't handle large messages, runs out of heap.
	• with ssl working it should really be part of factotum
	• merge Sascha's changes to Reply
	• autocomplete email addresses
	• listen on plumb for email addresses to mailto
	• merge in rfc822.b library

Calendar
	• access to Schedule needs to be locked.
	• print events for current week
	• use better defaults so schedule file already exists is mounted

sendmail.b
	• need "send" client to append to other user's mailboxes
	if no '@' and user's mailbox exists, then append.
	• add ssl3

daytime.b
	the string2tm doesn't work on the rfc822 dates in Mail

httpd
	• connection keep-alive hangs when interacting through
	telnet. probably need to replace bufio in the implementation.
	• test download of ranges.
	• cleanup directory. move CGI stuff out of there.

rpc
	• refactor disk/kfscmd, factotum/rpc, ndb/dnsquery, etc.


factotum
	• support logon for acme:sac to jones.net.
	• acme client to get authinfo dialog/feedkey

styxpersist.b
	• doesn't work
	• develop further to include lookup of registry, lookup using virgil maintain.
	• look at more recent (2006) work done on p9p for persistent connections

sort
	• runs out of memory

Acme clients
	adict
	juke
	pivotTable
	Search
	dialog/feedkey
	autocomplete -- type in the tag line, and the window contents refresh with
	matching words. like google suggest.
